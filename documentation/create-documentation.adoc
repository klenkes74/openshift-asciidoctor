= Generate documentation
Roland T. Lichti
{version}, {docdate}


== tl;dr:
The easiest way is to use the template provided as documentation.yaml.

== Where to place documentation
The documentation is cloned from a git repo. So you need the coordinates of one. Normally they consist of the URL and
the branch to use. If the documentation does not start at the root directory of the git repo, you can also add a
contextDir to define the entry point of the documentation.

== Basic requirements
The minimal requirement is a file called index.adoc for providing the index.html of the documentation pod.
